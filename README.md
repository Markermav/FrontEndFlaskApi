# Frontend Flask API for Library Management üìöüåê

Welcome to the Frontend Flask API for Library Management repository! This project provides a simple yet efficient way to manage a library using Flask. Users can view books in the library, fetch all available books, and even post their own books for lending.

## Project Overview

The Flask API consists of three main routes:
- **Home Route:** Users can access the home page, where they can see books or fetch all books in the library.
- **Library Route:** This route allows users to view all available books in the library.
- **Post Route:** Users can post their own books to lend them out to others.
